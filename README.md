Unofficial C# API wrapper for MyAnimeList Web API

The MalAPI folder contains the library and the MalCL contains the command line program that uses the aforementioned library for testing purposes of whatever.

The whole thing needs a rewrite btw.

Currently the thing is just set up to dump all the data from the REST to some data structures wiith abandon and technically its working.

Usability is total shit though so needs to be prettied up.
